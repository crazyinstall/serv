**0.3.0 (2016-11-22)**

* Add support for Python 3
* Remove support for different versions of different init systems. This seems like a redundant feature considering the the only difference is between Upstart versions (1 vs. 1.5 etc..) and that becomes irrelevant soon.
* Fix niceness limits check (never performed the check at all)
* Fix bug where if no environment variables are provided using the API, Serv would crash.
* Fix a bug where, in some situations, Serv will fail if it couldn't identify a supported init system.
* Fix a bug where serv will not fallback to auto-detection if it couldn't find a supported distribution in the static map.
* Show tracebacks if using Serv directly from Python (as opposed to when using the CLI).
* Replaced auto-detection of supported init system implementations with a static one to simplify things. There's really no need for such a complex mechanism.
* Updated to distro v1.0.1
* Updated click to v6.6
* Use pytest for tests instead of nose
* Add codecov.io coverage reports
* Add requires.io requirements monitoring
* Add landscape.io code health monitoring
* Added classifiers to setup.py
* Added setup.cfg for wheel release
